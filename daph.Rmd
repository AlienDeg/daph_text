## Getting the DAPH episode text

The code below is adapted from [Pawel Kapuscinski's](http://rpubs.com/aliendeg/daph) brilliant exploration of the Digital Analytics Power Hour podcast transcripts. 

It:

- Visits the [DAPH episode listing](http://www.analyticshour.io/all-podcast-episodes/)
- Scrapes all listing pages and gets a list of URLs 
- Scrapes each episode URL and pulls the episode transcript into a dataframe - `daph_post_text`.
- Tokenizes (i.e. breaks each passage of text into a single-row-per word) each episode transcript and appends the sentiment of each word according to the `bing` sentiment dictionary. Stores this in a dataframe, `daph_post_words`.


## Getting our list of URLs

Step 1 - load the (many) libraries we'll use and scrape the list of urls for each episode.

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(tm)
library(tidyr)
library(wordcloud)
library(tm)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(lubridate)

# Get the highest page count from the site
max_pages <- read_html("http://www.analyticshour.io/all-podcast-episodes/") %>% 
  html_nodes("a.page-numbers") %>% 
  html_text() %>% 
  as.numeric() %>% 
  max(na.rm = TRUE)

page_nums <- as.list(1:max_pages)

# Function to get a list of all archive urls along with the episode number and year
get_url_list <- function(page_num) {
  x <- read_html(paste0("http://www.analyticshour.io/all-podcast-episodes/page/", page_num))

  # Make a DF containing the url, year and episode number
  urls <- data.frame( urls = x %>% 
    html_nodes(paste0("body > div.super-container.light-icons > div.main-content.page.archive-page > div > div > div > div  div > footer > ul > li.title.not-truncate ")) %>%
    html_children %>% 
    as.character() %>% 
    str_extract('\\\".*?\\\"') %>% 
    str_replace_all(c('\"' = ''))) %>% 
    separate(urls, 
             into = c("bin", "bin2", "bin3", "year", "bin4", "bin5", "episode"),
             sep = "\\/",
             remove = FALSE) %>% 
    mutate(urls = as.character(urls), episode = str_replace_all(episode, "\\-.*", "")) %>% 
    select(urls, year, episode)
    
    urls
}

# Pull the urls list from the site. Ignore the "Too many values" error, this comes from the call to separate()
full_urls <- map_df(page_nums, get_url_list) 

full_urls

# Split the url DF into a list so it can be iteratively called by map_df in the next step
full_urls_split <- full_urls %>% 
  split(.$episode)

```

## Scraping the transcripts

Next, we visit each URL in turn, traverse to the transcript and convert into a dataframe. We add on a little metadata in new columns (timecodes for the start & end of a given passage, speaker name, the episode name and episode URL)

```{r}

# Function to scrape the web content per url, append the episode #, year and speaker name (where known) then tokenize into words
get_post_content <- function(ep_df) {
  # Quick line for debugging purposes
  # print(paste("Running for :", ep_df$url))
  url <- ep_df$url
  episode <- ep_df$episode
  year <- ep_df$year
  
  post_html <- read_html(url) 
  
  # Traverse down to the paragraph elements within the 'post' class
  post_ps <- post_html %>% 
    html_nodes(".post p") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    as.data.frame()
  
  # Get the post title
  post_title <- post_html %>% 
    html_nodes(".entry-title") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    as.character()
  
  # Get the guest name and initials
  guest <- post_title %>% 
    str_extract("with [a-zA-Z]* [a-zA-Z]*") %>% 
    str_replace_all(c("with " = ""))
  
  guest_initials <- guest %>% 
    str_extract_all("\\b[a-zA-Z]") %>% 
    unlist() %>% 
    str_c(collapse = "") %>% 
    paste0(":")
    
  # Rename the post_ps variable as it's automatically called '.' when converted from a list, which is problematic.
  names(post_ps) <- "text"
  
  # Filter to only elements which contain a timecode
  post_ps <- post_ps %>% 
    dplyr::filter(str_detect(text, "(\\d{2}:)")) 
  
  if (length(post_ps$text != 0)) {
    post_ps <- post_ps %>% 
      mutate(
        text = as.character(text),
        speaker = case_when(
          str_detect(text, paste0("(", guest_initials, ")|(", guest, ":)")) ~ guest,
          str_detect(text, "(MH:)|(Michael Helbling:)|(Michael:)") ~ "Drunk Helbs",
          str_detect(text, "(MK:)|(Moe Kiss:)|(Moe:)") ~ "Moe from down under",
          str_detect(text, "(TW:)|(Tim Wilson:)|(Tim:)") ~ "Grumpy Cat",
          TRUE ~ "Unknown"
        ),
      url = url,
      episode = as.numeric(episode),
      year = year,
      title = post_title,
      # Get the timecodes using regex extraction and handle variable timecode structure
      time_start = case_when(
        str_detect(text, "\\d:\\d{2}:\\d{2}") ~ as.numeric(hms(str_extract(text, "\\d:\\d{2}:\\d{2}"))),
          TRUE ~ as.numeric(ms(str_extract(text, "\\d{2}:\\d{2}")))
      ),
      time_end = lead(time_start, 1),
      duration = time_end - time_start
    )
    post_ps
  } else {
    NULL
  }
}

daph_post_text <- map_df(full_urls_split, get_post_content) %>% 
  arrange(episode, time_start)
saveRDS(daph_post_text, "datafiles/daph_post_text.rds") # Storing as an rds file locally to avoid 
daph_post_text
```


---

Now that we have our post text and post words dataframes, we can take a look at the data.

# Longest monologue

Off the bat, we can find out the longest sentence of all time, and who spoke it.

```{r}
monologue <- daph_post_text %>% 
  filter(speaker != "Unknown") %>% 
  arrange(desc(duration)) %>% 
  top_n(10, duration) %>% 
  select(speaker, text, title, duration)

monologue
```

So, our champion monologue is this gem from Tim Wilson in Episode 71, "Reinforcement Learning with Matt Gershoff". Hats off to Tim for the final sentence. At `monologue$duration[1]` seconds long, it stands a full `avg_duration <- mean(daph_post_text$duration, na.rm = TRUE); monologue$duration[1]-avgduration` seconds above the average speaking length of `avg_duration`s.

```{r}
monologue$text[1]
```

---


## Tokenize our words

At this point we can split the dataframe out by words, to allow us to run sentiment analysis and word counts for the charts to follow.

```{r}
data("stop_words")
daph_post_words <- daph_post_text %>% 
      unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text, format = "text") %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words)
saveRDS(daph_post_words, "datafiles/daph_post_words.rds")
```

## Profanity by presenter

To settle the debate for good, which presenter is the most sweary by episode?

```{r}

filter_presenters <- function(df) {
  filter(df, str_detect(speaker, "(Drunk)|(under)|(Grumpy)"))
}
swears <- daph_post_words %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "(shit)|(fuck)|(crap)"))

swears_by_speaker <- swears %>% 
  group_by(episode, speaker) %>% 
  filter_presenters() %>% 
  summarise(ep_count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(speaker) %>% 
  summarise(avg_swears = mean(ep_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker, avg_swears))

swears_by_speaker %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = speaker, y = avg_swears)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#3FA0D9") + 
  theme_hc() + 
  labs(
    x = "Speaker",
    y = "Avg. swear jar deposits per episode",
    title = "Avg. swear count by speaker",
    subtitle = "Was there ever any doubt?")
```


# Most talkative presenter

```{r}
# word count per episode by presenter


words_by_speaker <- daph_post_words %>% 
  filter_presenters() %>% 
  group_by(episode, speaker) %>% 
  filter(speaker!= "Unknown") %>% 
  summarise(ep_count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() 

wbs_overall <- words_by_speaker %>% 
  group_by(speaker) %>% 
  summarise(avg_words = mean(ep_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker, avg_words))

wbs_overall %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = speaker, y = avg_words)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#3FA0D9") + 
  theme_hc() + 
  xlab('Speaker') + 
  ylab('Avg words spoken per episode') + 
  ggtitle("Chatty Catty")

wbs_be <- words_by_speaker %>% 
  filter(ep_count!=0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(as.numeric(episode), ep_count, colour = speaker)) +
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Words spoken by episode, by speaker",
    y = "Words spoken",
    x = "Episode number",
    colour = "Speaker Name"
  )
library(plotly)
ggplotly(wbs_be)
```

# Episode sentiments

```{r}
daph_sentiment <- daph_post_words %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) 

sentiment_by_episode <- daph_sentiment %>% 
  count(episode, sentiment) %>% 
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

senti_plot <- sentiment_by_episode %>% 
  filter(episode > 50) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(episode, sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "DAPH overall sentiment by episode, 2017",
    y = "Sentiment (positive - negative)",
    x = "Episode Number"
  )

ggplotly(senti_plot)
```

Generally, the DAPH team are an optimistic, tree-hugging bunch of people. What happened for episode 69 ("The Biases of the Analyst"), though?

Let's take a look at which words caused all that negative skew.

```{r}
daph_sentiment %>% 
  filter(episode == 69) %>% 
  group_by(word, sentiment) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(sentiment, desc(n))
```

Turns out "bias" and "biases" are seen as negative words according to the bing sentiment dictionary. If we remove those two words, does it change the outlook?

```{r}
daph_sentiment %>% 
  filter(episode == 69, !str_detect(word, "bias")) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>% 
  count()
  
```

A bit, but it's still a negative episode overall. Words like "hard", "wrong", "disprove" and "shit" all contribute to a negative score overall. So, a happy analyst is an unbiased analyst.

# Happiest episode

Let's cheer ourselves up a bit - what about the happiest episode? That was # 57 (see our plot above).

```{r}
daph_sentiment %>% 
  filter(episode == 57) %>% 
  group_by(word, sentiment) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(sentiment), desc(n))
```

The language used here is largely descriptive, so we can't deduce too much. However, the subject matter of the episode overall is pretty interesting - that episode was "Open Data with Brett Hurt and Jon Loyens". So we might suggest that Open Data inspired the most excitement and positivity from the podcast team.
